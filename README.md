Hi Simina! 

Welcome to Microsoft! I'm so excited to have you on the team. ♥️Can't wait to see what we acomplish together.

By now, you already have your machine, your email address and a desk. On your desk, you'll also find a small box to welcome you to our team.

In the next few days and weeks, your goal is to get to know your team mates, understand the team's mission, the product, and our customers, and start getting to know the code base and land your first PR. I know - onboarding to a new team is a lot - but myself, your onboarding buddy and the team will guide you along the way.

If you have any concerns or questions, please feel free to come by my desk, ping me on slack, or text me directly.

Looking forward to working together! 
Laura
